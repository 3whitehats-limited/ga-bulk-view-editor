# Google Analytics - Bulk View Editor (Google Sheets Extension)

This is the source code for our [GA Bulk View Editor](https://www.3whitehats.com/ga-bulk-view-editor/) [Google Sheets extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ga-bulk-view-editor/jbiobmeocacbofbnmgbfpiaokbkkmmjk) to enable bulk modification of view settings in Google Analytics. This app is intended to be deployed via a distinct Google Sheets extension, however this can be built and tested within a single Google Sheet via the _Tools > Script Editor_ file menu.

**NOTE:** If you wish to use the extension follow the links above, the code in this repository serves as a reference for future development and is not required for typical usage of the live extension - unless you want to expand upon the functionality. Pull requests are welcome.
